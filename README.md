# 2023IST-Website-Crawford.Lieu
This is just a school project for IST.
## About this Repo
This repo was created for my elective IST subject (upgraded since 2023). This repo includes the work for Term 1 & 2 Assessment Tasks. The 'TestSite' folder contains files that were used for getting used to the HTML and CSS languages. The newer 'index.html' file contains the website for the Term 2 Assessment Tasks complete with Bootstrap HTML code. *(Link to Bootstrap [here](https://getbootstrap.com/))*
