# 2023IST-Website-Crawford.Lieu
This is just a school project for IST.
## About this Repo
This repository has been created for my elective IST subject (upgraded since 2023). This repo contains the work for the Term 1 & 2 assessment tasks. The 'TestSite' folder contains files used to familiarise myself with HTML and CSS. The newer 'index.html' file contains the Term 2 Assessment Tasks website complete with Bootstrap HTML code. *(Link to Bootstrap [here](https://getbootstrap.com/))*
